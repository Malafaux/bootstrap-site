        To help deal with climate change, you can reduce  your carbon emissions by walking or cycling rather than driving. You can also join us for an annual tree planting. For schedules on when we plan to do such things, see our Contact Us page for details on how to access us.

               Another way to help reduce the effects of climate change is to switch to cleaner energy sources, such as solar panels or perhaps purely hydro powered. Or, if you are perhaps an insane milllionaire who trusts themselves too much, you can run on nuclear power and pray that your area does not become a Chernobyl 2.0.
