        Tree Huggers Extraordinare is a not for profit climate change charity. We aim to plant trees and reduce carbon emmissions for the people of our organization. We accept donations that are forwarded towards use in the planting of trees through volunteers or third-party organizations. 
        
    
        There is more to explore on this earth and we intend to save it before the damage becomes to much. Join us, and we can save our planet

            We were founded last year, in the month of October. Trees around our neighbourhoods were dying and there weren't being any replanted nearby, so we took it upon ourselves to replant the dying trees that we cared so much about. After all, what is October without the crunch of amber leaves and the back pain of needing to rake them up?
